define classes:
  GameSpot
    occupiedBy (water[default], shipName)
  GameBoard
    list Grid
      Grid contains lists for rows, which makes a 12x12 gameboard
      Each spot on the grid gets initialized with a new GameSpot
      
      print grid with axes, use letters on one axis and nums on the other
      represent hits with X,  misses with O, and untested waters with ?
  Ships
    name
    length

    define an insertion checker that validates against an Own Grid

    define a hit checker that checks against an Enemie's Own Grid, then updates the Enemy Outlook

  define an insertion method for the ships:
    They will have a starting coordinate and a direction. These will need to be checked for validity before the insertion goes live into the gBoard
    This insertion method needs to work for human players and for the computer player

  define a ship randomizer for the computer player
    Utilize the insertion method, have any invalid positions automatically regenerated
  define a random guesser for the computer player

  define a method for checking if either player has lost the game

define "objects":  --do this before starting the game
